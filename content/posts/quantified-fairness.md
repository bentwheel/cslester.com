title: "Embracing a New Dimension of Model Tuning in Actuarial Model Development"

Late last autumn, I took an opportunity to respond to the Society of Actuaries' call for essays about potential disruptions and innovations in the actuarial practice space.

**The bad news**: I didn't win one of the top prizes.

**The good news**: My essay was published anyways, and you can read it [here](https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2020/actuarial-practice-innovation.pdf).


Most of the essay serves as a rehash and survey of work explained in [The Ethical Algorithm: The Science of Socially Aware Algorithm Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44244975-the-ethical-algorithm), but ends with some discussion about how the evolving generation of new actuarial modeling and predictive analytics has considerations yet to be worked out by the [Actuarial Standards Board](http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/) as they prepare to release the new, long-awaited [Modeling ASOP](http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/asops/modeling-3/). More broadly, insurance regulators at all levels of government in the US and abroad are treating applications of predictive analytics within the actuarial modeling space with a highly variable level of scrutiny.
